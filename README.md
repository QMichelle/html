		<h2> Introduction of Who I Am </h2>

		<p>
		I am a Senior at Metropolitan State University of Denver, <strong> GO RoadRunners!!!</strong>
		I am Looking to complete my Bachelors Degree in Geography with a GIS Minor.
		Once a Civil Engineering Student, after my Associates in Architectural Drafting, I reviewed my options and came to conclude
		that GIS was more acclaimated for what I want to do.

		In addition to the Scholar, I have raised my five siblings, while my parents worked to provide for us. Mothered six of my own 
		and three of the five stepchildren.  I am a proud wife to my best friend!  I love construction, design and the innovations that 
		have taken place in the recent years.  I was a single mother to five of my children and held two jobs to provide for them, never
		will I say that this is easy, but I will say it tries your resolve and builds character. 			
			
		My future goals are to build a corporation in the AEC Arena and build and cultivate 
		legacy that I leave behind in many years to come!
